Draw an ER diagram for the following relevant information about all the airplanes stationed and maintained at the airport. Be sure to indicate the various attributes of each entity and relationship set; also specify the key and participation constraints for each relationship set. Specify any necessary overlap constraint (Allowed/Disallowed) and covering (or participation) constraint (Yes/No) as well.
• Every airplane has a registration number and date acquired; and each airplane is of a specific model.
• The airport accommodates a number of airplane models, and each model is identified by a model number (e.g., DC-1O) and has a capacity and a weight.
• A number of technicians work at the airport. For each technician, the airport management would like to keep track the technician name, SSN, address, phone number, salary, and the name of technical school where the technician graduated.
• Each technician is an expert on one or more plane model(s), and his or her expertise may overlap with that of other technicians. The airport management would like to record the date that a technician became an expert on a particular plane model.
• Traffic controllers must have an annual medical examination. For each traffic controller, the airport needs to keep track of the SSN, name, address, phone number, salary, and the date of the most recent exam. A traffic controller cannot be a technician at the same time.
• In addition to technicians and traffic controllers, the airport also employs other types of employees. For each employee, the airport needs to keep track of the Social Security Number (SSN), name, address, phone number, and salary. All airport employees belong to a union. The airport management would like to keep track of the union membership number of each employee. Assume that each employee is uniquely identified by a social security number.
• The airport has a number of tests that are used periodically to ensure that airplanes are still airworthy. Each test has a Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) test number, a name, and a maximum possible score.
• The FAA requires the airport to keep track of each time a given airplane is tested by a given technician using a given test. For each testing event, the information needed is the date, the number of hours the technician spent doing the test, and the score the airplane received on the test.
